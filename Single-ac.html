                Rack mount LCD monitors can save you a lot of space and help you
                form a convenient and efficient desktop for your work or home
                study. The rack mount is set up so that the keyboard and LCD
                monitor are on a sliding rack that lest you move them out from
                your desk or over it. Once you decide to invest in the rack
                mount LCD monitor, you will have to install the rack and the
                monitor. Here, then, are steps in installing rack mount LCD
                monitors.

                The first step in installing rack mount LCD monitors is to get
                out and get one. They are available at most any home office or
                electronics store. Since the rack mounts are becoming more
                popular, they are easier to find now then aver before. Once you
                have your set, bring it home and spread all of the parts out
                along with the instructions so you can find what you need.

                The first step will be to install the slides on your desk. Some
                rack mounting sets will include slides that are “handed.” That
                means that each slide is assigned a side of the monitor rack,
                but there are also sets where either slide can go on either
                side. Consult the instructions with your set to make sure you
                have mounted them correctly.
